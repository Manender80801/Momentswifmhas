It was the day when i started my first job. It's a different feeling when we start  earning  ourselves. When we start a new job it enables us to learn new skills,  it offer us the opportunity to meet new people . It provide  the meaning and purpose in life as we contibute to the society. With new job we get a new identity . And those regular paychecks provides  the security and stability which we all need to survive.

It was the last day of my College. As we all have gone through the same phase in our life , we all know about the college life how awesome it was from the beginning to end . I still remember my first day of college . It was best feeling after the school i had , as time goes on we create memories from studying together to bunking classes sometimes. Eating in canteen to the playing games in playground. All those silly fights . Working hard together to fulfill our dreams . I still remember everything.  Years passed, the ending is always painful as last day at college is the moment where we all know this beautiful phase of time will not come back, so it is difficult to say goodbyes. That thing made felt sad.
